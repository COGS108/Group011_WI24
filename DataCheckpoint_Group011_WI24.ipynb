    "How can we predict the level of interest in various TikTok fashion trends across New York and California using TikTok trend interest score data from January 2019 to December 2023 using a model that inputs the fashion trend name, monthly time data, and region to predict an interest rating between 0 - 100 and an associated label of 'low' (interest score < 25), 'rising' (interest score < 50), 'popular' (interest score < 75), and 'trending (interest score > 75) for the specified input in 2024? <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This question aims to develop a predictive model that evaluates the popularity of TikTok fashion trends in different regions and times, using a quantifiable interest rating system. The focus on a state-by-state analysis allows for a detailed understanding of regional preferences and trends overtime. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We specifically focus on New York and California because they are the top 2 most populous states in the US and also have high TikTok usage. Additionally, using our API pytrends to collect data off of Google trends is limited in the number of search queries so we can only choose around 3 states to be represented in this research. <br>\n",

    "for the term. This score does not indicate the absolute search volume but rather shows the search term's popularity relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A higher score means more people are searching for that particular term at that time, while a lower score indicates lesser interest. The data is useful for identifying trends and understanding how interest in certain topics changes over time. <br>"

    "Our team is curious to understand how current fashion trends can be understood to predict the rating of a piece of clothing. We aim to create a prediction model that can take types of clothing and dates as input to predict the rating of a piece of clothing. We hope this model will have real-world application by possibly allowing companies to predict ratings for different clothing pieces based on GenZ fashion to potentially improve clothing purchase rates. Many datasets exist that contain information about women’s clothing including product descriptions, reviews, and ratings. However, we would like to incorporate TikTok trends into our dataset to use TikTok fashion trends as a data feature when predicting the rating for clothing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, we have a few datasets including Amazon Women's Fashion Dataset<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) and Women's Ecommerce Clothing Reviews<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) that seem relevant to our project goals. Based on our initial research, our ideal dataset would include columns for clothing type, clothing description, clothing review, clothing rating, and a label for each row representing what type of TikTok trend the clothing item falls into based on the clothing description. Additionally, we found other projects that have approached similar problems. One example is this project: Amazon Women's Clothing Review<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). In the project, the researcher performs EDA by analyzing various trends in the sentiment for Amazon clothing reviews. We plan to incorporate a similar approach to our EDA by visualizing the trends in rating prediction, but analyzing prediction from the perspective of TikTok trends and views for different TikTok trends influencing rating. Another project that had a similar approach is Rating prediction<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). This project performs rating prediction similar to what we would like to do. My team plans to use this project as an example when creating our prediction model and also use a similar approach for EDA using TF-IDF to assign TikTok trends to different clothing descriptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first project<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) found that the main trigrams from the reviews fall into the positive sentiment categories. For instance, the research found that fit true size, run true size, fit just right, love love love, fit like glove, usual wear size, and every time wear were some of the most prominent trigrams. This research conducts more of a sentiment analysis to show that reviews and ratings are more positive in their dataset. The second project<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) performed EDA and tried to analyze what kinds of age groups make what kinds of reviews and ratings. The research project found that layering, lounge and swim clothing tend to have the best reviews. The research also interestingly found that higher age groups had worse ratings. What we found interesting about this project is that TF-IDF Vectorization was used to convert the clothing descriptions into vectors to be passed as input to the prediction model. I think we are going to have to take a similar approach to our project.\n",

    "## Data overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We compiled a list of the top 30 TikTok trends from 1/1/2020 through 12/31/2023 using ChatGPT and external sources <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) and used Google Trends to search up these trend names and understand how the interest score rating changed overtime for them. There, we observed the data for “Interest over time”—which represents search interest (a value of 0-100 to represent peak popularity) relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region (the United States) and time (our aforementioned time frame)---where users searching for this trend name also searched with related queries. We collected 30 datasets by searching up 30 different top TikTok fashion trends on Google Trends to form our overall dataset of ~6500 datapoints. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We describe the datasets below. We will be combining all of these datasets using pd.concat and then cleaning all the merged data together. The datasets will be stacked in rows along axis = 1 and then cleaned. The code for cleaning and combining the datasets is below the dataset descriptions. We use the [Pytrends API](https://pypi.org/project/pytrends/) to gather each dataset in a for loop into a separate data structure and then combine all the datasets using a dataframe at the very end to be cleaned. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Cleaning Procedure: <br>\n",
    "The data that we began with was relatively tidy because we made sure to choose states ('CA' and 'NY) which have higher populations and higher TikTok usage so there were no null values for the interest score for the fashion trends we searched up. We initially also chose Texas as a state in our research, but Texas gave us nearly 3000 null values because the fashion trends were not searched enough within the time frame we chose to actually have interest scores on Google Trends, so we removed Texas from our analysis. We also did some pre-processing steps where for each TikTok trend we found, we searched up the keyword on Google Trends and saw whether the interest score graphs had an updward, downward, or rising and falling trend existed for the interest score on Google Trends. We removed all fashion trends that lacked a relationship between interest score overtime. We also removed all fashion trends that gave an error saying not enough values to be displayed. The main data cleaning we had to do involved merging the different datasets together and cleaning the data to be appropriate to pass into a Machine Learning model for prediction. Here are the various data cleaning steps we took: <br>\n",
    "1. Merge all 30 datasets together \n",
    "2. Use .unique() to make sure all 30 trends were added to the dataframe  \n",
    "3. Check if any null values exist, remove all data for fashion trends with null values \n",
    "4. Make sure we have >100 observations for each fashion trend, if not, expand the timeframe \n",
    "5. Rename the columns to be more clean \n",
    "6. Apply a function to make a column that transforms each interest score observation into a label: 'low', 'rising', 'popular', 'trending' so that these labels can be predicted along with the interest score \n",
    "7. Make sure labels have been assigned correctly \n",
    "8. Create a new column that converts dates to numeric months for the ML model \n",
    "9. Perform one hot encoding for the trends to be used for the ML model \n",
    "10. Remove the 'date' and 'trend' columns because they are no longer needed\n",

However there are biases in regard to the time of the data we gathered.

It's important to recognize that our dataset represents users who actively engage with TikTok and have consistent internet access, so it does not account for places where trends have little effect. While acknowledging the influence of additional variables such as zoning and access to clothing stores on sales, we hope that our data could provide valuable suggestions for companies aiming to align their clothing offerings with popular social media trends.\n",

Additionally, it may be hard to address issues of racial representation in the dataset, or biases towards specific bodies in relation to clothes trends. Although these issues may arise, our best course of action is to research and incorporate ethically sourced data. Our focus on choosing quality datasets from the start will ensure our analysis can be ethically predictive of the population.\n",
